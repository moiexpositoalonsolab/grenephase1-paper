# This script analyzes the effect of a specific SNP, likely associated with or within
# the TSF gene region, on flowering time phenotypes
# (measured at 10째C and 16째C growth chamber conditions).

# The script performs the following main steps:
# 1. Loads genotype data for a subset of SNPs (including the target SNP) and phenotype data.
# 2. Extracts genotype information for the specific SNP of interest.
# 3. Merges genotype data with phenotype data based on ecotype/sample identifiers.
# 4. Generates boxplots to visualize the relationship between the target SNP genotype
#    and flowering time phenotypes.

# --- Required Input Files ---
# - key_files/founder_ecotype_names.csv: List of founder ecotype names.
# - key_files/subset_TSF.recode.vcf: VCF file containing genotype data for a subset of SNPs (should include the target SNP).
# - key_files/atlas_phenotype_matrix_withid.csv: CSV file containing flowering time and other phenotype data with ecotype/sample IDs.

# --- Output Files ---
# - The script generates plots directly using `matplotlib.pyplot.show()`, which displays the plots.
#   If saving the plots to files is desired, `plt.savefig()` calls would need to be added.
#   Based on the analysis, it will produce two boxplots: one for FT10 and one for FT16.

# --- Import Libraries ---

# The shape will be (number_of_samples, number_of_alleles), typically (samples, 2) for diploid data.
genotypes = genotype_data[:, snp_index, :]

# and the corresponding sample ID.

# In[58]: # Merge phenotype and genotype data


# Merge the phenotype DataFrame ('pheno') with the target SNP genotype DataFrame ('x4').
# The merge is performed based on the 'id' column, linking phenotype data to genotypes.
